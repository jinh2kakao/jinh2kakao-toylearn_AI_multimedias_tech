## Prompts

```
[SCENE: A high-resolution, full-screen UI for a "Prompt Library" desktop web application, dark mode. The design emphasizes a content-first, "full-bleed" aesthetic similar to a modern image gallery.]

[LAYOUT:
A "Full-Bleed" or "Edge-to-Edge" layout.
**Zero margin on the left side.** Minimal margins/padding (e.g., 8-12px) on the top, right, and bottom.
The main content area is a dense "Masonry Grid" (Pinterest-style) that fills the entire viewport, right up against the navigation bars.
A very thin, "static" (fixed-position) vertical navigation bar is flush against the far left edge.]

[ELEMENTS:
1.  **Expandable Left Navigation Bar (LNB):**
    * **Minimal State (Default):** A very thin, dark vertical bar. It only displays high-contrast icons for "Explore," "My Library," "Suggest-a-Prompt," and "Upgrade to Pro."
    * **Expanded State (On Click):** A "chevron" (>) or "hamburger" icon at the top of the bar allows it to expand, pushing the masonry grid slightly to the right to reveal the full text labels next to the icons.
2.  **Integrated Top Bar:** A clean, minimal bar at the top, containing a wide search input ("Search by role..."), filter icons, and user account controls. It is integrated directly above the grid with minimal padding.
3.  **Main Content (Masonry Grid):** Filled with "Prompt Cards" of varying heights.
4.  **Prompt Cards (Standard):** Each card clearly displays structured data: 'Role' (e.g., "UX Designer"), 'Task' (e.g., "Generate User Persona"), and a snippet of the prompt.
5.  **Premium Cards (Freemium Model):** Some cards are visually distinct with a small 'Lock' icon or a 'PRO' badge in the corner. The preview text might be slightly blurred to encourage upgrades.]

[STYLE & AESTHETICS:
Modern, professional, immersive, and tech-focused.
Subtle "Glassmorphism" or blur effects on the navigation elements.
Typography is crisp and highly legible (e.g., Inter, SF Pro).
The focus is on the content grid, creating a "moodboard" feel.]

[COLOR PALETTE:
Dominant Dark Mode: Deep charcoal gray ($#1E1E24$) or true black ($#000000$) for the background and nav bars.
Primary Accent: Vibrant blue ($#007AFF$) or magenta ($#E040FB$) for CTAs and 'Pro' badges.
Text/Icons: Pure white ($#FFFFFF$) or off-white ($#F0F0F0$) for high contrast.]
